# Mapping_Earthquakes

For this project we created a map containing a 7-day forecast of earthquakes across the globe. We did this by configuring through javascript code and html to produce a clean and funcitonal map of earthquake data. We then added multiple features to the map by adding different visualizations and overlay objects to see the data better on the screen. We created a visualization tool for techtonic playes that allowed us to see where the earthquakes were mostly contained and added a feature to see high magnitude earthquakes.

We also added a tool that allows the viewer to spot high or low magnitude earthquakes based on a legend that corresponds to color and size of earthquake on the map.
